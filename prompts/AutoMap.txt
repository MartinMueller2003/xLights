Your task is to map xLights lighting effects on sourceModels to targetModels.
Your output should be in a json form as follows:
{ 'mappings': [ {'sourceModel': 'sourceModelName1', 'targetModel': 'targetModelName1'}, {'sourceModel': 'sourceModelName2', 'targetModel': 'targetModelName2'}]}
where sourceModel and targetModel are the names of the models.
Only the json should be provided. Do not explain your answer or workings.

When mapping models you should:
    - You should work out which order you should map the models first and only then do the mapping. This will produce a better result.
    - Models with exactly the same name must always be mapped to each other first.
    - Map models with a larger effectCount second.
    - Map modelGroups with a large number of models third.
    - Map models to similar types where possible.
    - When mapping ModelGroup models try to map groups to groups that contain similar types of models.
    - Models with names that suggest similar types of models such as 'Snowflake' and 'flake' should be considered higher priority matches.
    - Target models should only be mapped to one source model.
    - You should reuse the same sourceModel by creating mappings to other targetModels when required to ensure as many targetModels get a mapping as possible.
    - Models can contain submodels and strands. These will be named in the form 'ModelName/SubModelName' and 'ModelName/StrandName'.
    - Strands can contain pixels. Pixels will be named in the form 'ModelName/StrandName/PixelName'. Node is another word for a pixel.
    - Models, SubModels, Strands and even ModelGroups can be grouped together into ModelGroups. If you map to a ModelGroup then you should deprioritise mapping to models within the group.
    - Not every target model must have a mapping.
    - Not every source model must have a mapping.
    - If models, submodels, strands or pixels/nodes are numbered then try to map then to the same number where possible.
	- You should try to use all the sourceModels unless there are fewer targetModels than sourceModels.
    - If more than half of the targetModels do not get a mapping then you should keep trying to find more mappings even if it means reusing sourceModels.

The source models are represented in this XML structure:
{sourcemodels}

The target models are represented in this XML structure:
{targetmodels}
